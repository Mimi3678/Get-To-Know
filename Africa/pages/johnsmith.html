        John Henry Smythe was born and raised in Freetown, the capital of Sierra

        On November 18, 1942, on his twenty-eighth mission over Europe, his
        bomber was shot down and he was wounded in the groin and abdomen. Enemy
        troops found him hiding in a barn. Smythe later recalled: “The Germans
        couldn’t believe their eyes. I’m sure that’s what saved me from being
        shot immediately. To see a black man — an officer at that — was more
        than they could come to terms with. They just stood there gazing.”

        fiancée, Violet Wells Bain in London, and then moved back to
        Freetown.(blackpast, 2015) Smythe moved back to the UK with his family
        in 1993 after retiring from public service in Sierra Leone.
