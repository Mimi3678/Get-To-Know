      <p>
        Born in New Jersey on March 5, 1983, Adama moved to Sierra Leone aged
        four with her parents and later lived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The
        Kargbo family returned to the United States when Adama was 10 years old.
        After high school, she attended the Parsons School of Design in Paris
        before moving to New York.

        In New York, Adama worked for Flaunt magazine and Magnet Management. She
        also spent her early career working on fashion campaigns for big brands
        like Versace and Prada, before striking out on her own. She moved back
        to Sierra Leone and launched Aschobi Designs. Since its debut, Aschobi
        Designs has been featured in stories by Reuters, BBC and CNN.
