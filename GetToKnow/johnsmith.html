        John Henry Smythe was born and raised in Freetown, the capital of Sierra
        Leone. Before joinen the RAF (Royal Air Force) in 1940, John was then
        working as a civil servant.

        On November 18, 1942, on his twenty-eighth mission over Europe, his
        bomber was shot down and he was wounded in the groin and abdomen. Enemy
        troops found him hiding in a barn. Smythe later recalled: “The Germans
        couldn’t believe their eyes. I’m sure that’s what saved me from being
        shot immediately. To see a black man — an officer at that — was more
        than they could come to terms with. They just stood there gazing.”

        In 1951, Smythe became a practicing barrister, married his Grenadian
        fiancée, Violet Wells Bain in London, and then moved back to
        Freetown.(blackpast, 2015) Smythe moved back to the UK with his family
        in 1993 after retiring from public service in Sierra Leone.

        John Smythe died in Thame, Oxfordshire on July 9, 1996 and was buried in
        St. Mary’s Church Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and five
        children.(blackpast, 2015)
